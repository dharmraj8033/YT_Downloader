# Fix for "spawn python ENOENT" Error on Render

## Problem
When deploying this application on Render (or similar platforms), users encountered the error:
```
Spawn error: spawn python ENOENT
```

This error occurred when trying to download videos, even though the application was successfully deployed and accessible.

## Root Cause
The application was incorrectly trying to execute yt-dlp by spawning `python` on non-Windows platforms:

```javascript
// OLD CODE (INCORRECT)
const ytDlpCmd = isWin ? ytDlpPath : 'python';
const ytDlpArgs = isWin ? ['--verbose', '--dump-json', url] : [ytDlpPath, '--verbose', '--dump-json', url];
const ytDlp = spawn(ytDlpCmd, ytDlpArgs, { cwd: __dirname });
```

This approach had two problems:
1. It assumed Python would be available in the system PATH
2. It was unnecessary because modern yt-dlp is a standalone executable with embedded Python

On Render and many other deployment platforms, Python is not installed by default or not available in PATH, causing the "ENOENT" (Error NO ENTry) error.

## Solution
The fix was simple - run yt-dlp directly as a standalone executable on all platforms:

```javascript
// NEW CODE (CORRECT)
const ytDlpArgs = ['--verbose', '--dump-json', url];
const ytDlp = spawn(ytDlpPath, ytDlpArgs, { cwd: __dirname });
```

### Changes Made
1. **server.js**: Updated two locations where yt-dlp was spawned:
   - In `getVideoInfo()` function (line ~25-26)
   - In `/api/download` endpoint (line ~178-179)

2. **Dockerfile**: Removed python3 from dependencies since it's no longer needed

## Why This Works
Modern yt-dlp binaries (downloaded from GitHub releases) are:
- **Standalone executables**: They contain an embedded Python interpreter
- **Platform-specific**: Different binaries for Windows (.exe) and Unix/Linux
- **Self-contained**: No external Python installation required

The download-yt-dlp.js script already downloads the correct standalone binary for each platform.

## Verification
After this fix:
- ✅ yt-dlp runs directly without Python dependency
- ✅ Works on Render and other platforms where Python is not available
- ✅ Smaller Docker image (no Python installation needed)
- ✅ Faster deployment (fewer dependencies to install)

## Testing
To verify the fix works in your environment:

```bash
# Test that yt-dlp is executable
./yt-dlp --version

# Test the server
npm start
# Then try downloading a video through the web interface
```

## For Deploying on Render
1. Make sure to pull the latest changes with this fix
2. The build command should be: `npm install`
3. The start command should be: `npm start`
4. No additional environment variables are needed for yt-dlp to work

The application will now work correctly on Render without requiring Python to be installed.
